This will be a first trial website that is written as a part of The Odin Project.

I will learn to set up a simple website with multiple pages and simply practice HTML/CSS.


Reflection post project:
The HTML aspects were useful to get more muscle memory for the things I've learned.
The greatest benefit from this project however was the practice with Git and with using Github.
